I ordered 2500 SVG maps from worldhistorymaps.com.
CD didn't work on my old macbook, but i was able to use Raven's laptop to
transfer them via thumb drive.
out of the box, the maps render poorly in all browsers except Opera.
In Opera, it's impossible to zoom. And the features are tiny (Europe vs. world)

The problem is that they're using a clipping layer to impose water boundaries.
This is clever -- it lets them use much simpler polygons for each
country/nation and keep the water boundaries constant across time. They include
a PNG clipping layer and an SVG clipping layer. Only Opera lines these up
correctly. Every browser handles the SVG clipping fine, but they screw up the
SVG. Even Opera messes up the alignment when you zoom via the SVG file's
"zoomBox" directive.

I'm able to zoom nicely in Safari one I comment out the SVG clipping path (Wgeo.svg).

ImageMagick supports SVG, so rasterizing from the command line may be the best
option of all.


This brings up some questions in terms of how I store shapes. I'd assumed that
every country would include things like coastlines. There would be a feature in
the editor which would let you snap to coastlines, rivers, lakes, etc.
But maybe that's too expensive. Maybe it's better to have loose, simple shapes
and apply a filter later.

The SVG clipping layer is pretty large (1.1MB). A good approach might be to
serve up a tiled clipping layer, ala Google Maps. Then shapes could be
transmitted simply and the clipping could be done in-browser. worldhistorymaps
implements their clipping layer as a full image of the earth's water. But a
black/white mask would work better.

Questions:
- What is the overall size of the Roman Empire paths across all time?
- How much do paths change from year to year? How large is the avg. diff?
